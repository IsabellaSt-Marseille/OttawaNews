  <h2>Myth Check: Is It Illegal to Paint Your Door Purple in Ottawa?</h2>

  <p>
    You may have heard the claim that painting your front door purple is illegal
    in parts of Ottawa. This information has been shared online and through word
    of mouth, but it is important to check whether it is true.
  </p>

  <div class="info-box">
    <strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>
    There is <strong>no city-wide law</strong> in Ottawa that makes it illegal to
    paint your front door purple.
  </div>

  <p>
    The City of Ottawa does not have a by-law that restricts door colours for
    private homes. In most neighbourhoods, homeowners are free to choose the
    colour of their doors.
  </p>

  <p>
    In some cases, special rules may apply to:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Heritage buildings</li>
    <li>Homes with a homeowners’ association (HOA)</li>
    <li>Buildings with specific design agreements</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These rules are not city laws and only apply in specific situations. Residents
    can contact the City of Ottawa or review official by-laws if they are unsure.
  </p>

  <h3>How This Information Was Checked</h3>

  <p>
    City staff reviewed current Ottawa by-laws and housing guidelines to confirm
    this information. Sources include official city documents and public records.
  </p>

  <p>
    This page is reviewed regularly to ensure information is accurate and up to
    date.
